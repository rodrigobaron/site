üëã Hello, I am Rodrigo Baron. I am from Brazil currently living in Toledo - PR. I have Software Engineering background and really love to code, have more than 10 years of SWE experience. Also worked as Data Scientist and currently as Machine Learning Engineer at [GAVB](https://www.gavb.com.br/)+[GB](https://www.grupoboticario.com.br/).  

Worked in many production sofware soluctions, then after many hours study machine learning (tensorflow 1.x at time) got a job to work as Data Scientist using deeplearning. After some years naturally got a position of Machine Learning Engineer working with Data Scientists and Data Engineers to put models in production. Also love learn and do OSS projects.  

Outside of job title and sofware in general I like listen Rock n' Roll such Metallica, Pearl Jam and so .. drink some beer üç∫ and travel. The traveling part is one thing I would like do more than I'm doing actually..
