üëã Hello! My name is Rodrigo Baron. I am from Brazil and live in Toledo-PR. I have over ten years of software engineering experience and seven years as a Machine Learning Engineer, currently working as an MLOps consultant at [GAVB](https://www.gavb.com.br/)+[GB](https://www.grupoboticario.com.br/).

Throughout my career, I have worked on numerous production software solutions. Then, I transitioned into machine learning engineering, where I built statistical models and deep learning for computer vision applications. Over time, I also developed pipelines and platforms to deploy models in production.

In addition to my professional roles, I have managed data projects as a principal ML engineer and taken on leadership responsibilities.

I also enjoy listening to rock 'n' roll bands like Metallica, Pearl Jam, and others... drinking beer üç∫ and traveling.
